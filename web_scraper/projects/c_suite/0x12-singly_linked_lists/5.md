# 5. The Hare and the Tortoise




Write a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.

You are allowed to use the printf function

```julien@ubuntu:~/0x12. Singly linked lists$ cat 100-main.c
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - check the code
 *
 * Return: Always 0.
 */
int main(void)
{
    printf("(A tortoise, having pretty good sense of a hare's nature, challenges one to a race.)\n");
    return (0);
}
julien@ubuntu:~/$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 100-main.c 100-first.c -o first
julien@ubuntu:~/$ ./first 
You're beat! and yet, you must allow,
I bore my house upon my back!
(A tortoise, having pretty good sense of a hare's nature, challenges one to a race.)
