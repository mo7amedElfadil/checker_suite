# 5. How many legs does a dog have if you call his tail a leg? Four. Saying that a tail is a leg doesn't make it a leg




Write a function that frees dogs.

Prototype: void free_dog(dog_t *d);

```julien@ubuntu:~/0x0d. structures, typedef$ cat 5-main.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "dog.h"

/**
 * main - check the code
 *
 * Return: Always 0.
 */
int main(void)
{
    dog_t *my_dog;

    my_dog = new_dog("Poppy", 3.5, "Bob");
    printf("My name is %s, and I am %.1f :) - Woof!\n", my_dog->name, my_dog->age);
    free_dog(my_dog);
    return (0);
}
