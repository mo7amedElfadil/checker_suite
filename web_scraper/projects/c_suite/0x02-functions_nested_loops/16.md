# 16. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+



Write a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

The numbers should be separated by comma, followed by a space  ,
You are allowed to use the standard library
You are not allowed to use any other library (You can’t use GMP etc…)
You are not allowed to use long long, malloc, pointers, arrays/tables, or structures
You are not allowed to hard code any Fibonacci number (except for 1 and 2)
