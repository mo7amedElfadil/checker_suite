# 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off



Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Print all the letters except q and e
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar twice in your code

```julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 4-print_alphabt.c -o 4-print_alphabt
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./4-print_alphabt 
abcdfghijklmnoprstuvwxyz
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./4-print_alphabt | grep [eq]
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ 
```
