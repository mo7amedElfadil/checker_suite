# 3. cp



Write a program that copies the content of a file to another file.

Usage: cp file_from file_to
if the number of argument is not the correct one, exit with code 97 and print Usage: cp file_from file_to, followed by a new line, on the POSIX standard error
if file_to already exists, truncate it
if file_from does not exist, or if you can not read it, exit with code 98 and print Error: Can't read from file NAME_OF_THE_FILE, followed by a new line, on the POSIX standard error


where NAME_OF_THE_FILE is the first argument passed to your program

if you can not create or if write to file_to fails, exit with code 99 and print Error: Can't write to NAME_OF_THE_FILE, followed by a new line, on the POSIX standard error


where NAME_OF_THE_FILE is the second argument passed to your program

if you can not close a file descriptor , exit with code 100 and print Error: Can't close fd FD_VALUE, followed by a new line, on the POSIX standard error


where FD_VALUE is the value of the file descriptor

Permissions of the created file: rw-rw-r--. If the file already exists, do not change the permissions
You must read 1,024 bytes at a time from the file_from to make less system calls. Use a buffer
You are allowed to use dprintf
