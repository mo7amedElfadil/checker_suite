# 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off



Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

Print all the letters except q and e
You can only use one print function with string format
You can only use one loop in your code
You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
You are not allowed to import any module
