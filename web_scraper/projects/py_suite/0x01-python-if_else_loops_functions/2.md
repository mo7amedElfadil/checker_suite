# 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game



Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

You can only use one print function with string format
You can only use one loop in your code
You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
You are not allowed to import any module

```guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./2-print_alphabet.py
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzguillaume@ubuntu:~/0x01$
```
