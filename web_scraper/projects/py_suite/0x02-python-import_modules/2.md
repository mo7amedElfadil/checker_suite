# 2. How to make a script dynamic!



Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.

The output should be:


Number of argument(s) followed by argument (if number is one) or arguments (otherwise), followed by
: (or . if no arguments were passed) followed by
a new line, followed by (if at least one argument),
one line per argument:


the position of the argument (starting at 1) followed by :, followed by the argument value and a new line


Your code should not be executed when imported
The number of elements of argv can be retrieved by using: len(argv)
You do not have to fully understand lists yet, but imagine that argv can be used just like a C array: you can use an index to walk through it. There are other ways (which will be preferred for future project tasks), if you know them you can use them.

```guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ ./2-args.py 
0 arguments.
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ ./2-args.py Hello
1 argument:
1: Hello
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ ./2-args.py Hello Welcome To The Best School
6 arguments:
1: Hello
2: Welcome
3: To
4: The
5: Best
6: School
