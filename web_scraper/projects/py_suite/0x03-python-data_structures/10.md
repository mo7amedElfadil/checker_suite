# 10. Only by 2



Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

Prototype: def divisible_by_2(my_list=[]):
Return a new list with True or False, depending on whether the integer at the same position in the original list is a multiple of 2
The new list should have the same size as the original list
You are not allowed to import any module

```guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x03$ cat 10-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
divisible_by_2 = __import__('10-divisible_by_2').divisible_by_2

my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
list_result = divisible_by_2(my_list)

i = 0
while i < len(list_result):
    print("{:d} {:s} divisible by 2".format(my_list[i], "is" if list_result[i] else "is not"))
    i += 1

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x03$ ./10-main.py
0 is divisible by 2
1 is not divisible by 2
2 is divisible by 2
3 is not divisible by 2
4 is divisible by 2
5 is not divisible by 2
6 is divisible by 2
